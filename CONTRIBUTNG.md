# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

Please read the PAVICS [Developer Documentation](https://pavics-sdi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/index.html) and 
[End-to-End Workflow Test Documentation](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/PAVICS-e2e-workflow-tests#readme) to get started.

Since this repository can be used to test multiple organization's production server, contributions should be backward-compatible whenever possible, or feature a toggle switch so that organizations can activate the new feature on their own schedule. To encourage review in a timely manner, contributions should be simple and focused (do not mix multiple goals) and well explained (describe the "why" and the "impact/behavior change" on existing production deployment, as requested in the contribution template).

To find out how these organizations work together, please look at the server deployment repository [contributions guideline](https://github.com/bird-house/birdhouse-deploy/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTNG.md)
