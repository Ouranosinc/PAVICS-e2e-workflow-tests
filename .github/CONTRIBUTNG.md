# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

Please read the PAVICS [Developer Documentation](https://pavics-sdi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/index.html) and 
[End-to-End Workflow Test Documentation](https://github.com/Ouranosinc/PAVICS-e2e-workflow-tests#readme) to get started.

Since this repository can be used to test multiple organization's production server, contributions should be backward-compatible as much as possible or feature a toggle so that organizations can activate the new feature when ready without being disturbed in the meantime.

To find out how these organizations work together, please look at the server deployment repository [contributions guideline](https://github.com/bird-house/birdhouse-deploy/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTNG.md)
