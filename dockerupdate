# "update" release makes it faster to build and release and also allow us
# sort of pin the entire existing working environment if we foresee many
# disruptive updates ahead and we are not ready to absorb them.

# Basically allowing us to still release new key components without being
# impacted by other changing components that we are not ready to deal with.

# Full and clean release are much preferred so this is to be used in last
# resort only, do not abuse.
